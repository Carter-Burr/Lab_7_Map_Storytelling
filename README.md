For this lab, I decided to take a look at the Husky Football season through a Map-Based Storytelling project.
This map show the Husky College Football Playoff run and takes a look at where they have traveled through the season.

For the point data to represent all of the stadiums the Huskies played at for their playoff run, I made the Json file myself.
For the state data, I took a Json file of the States from [Eric Tech](https://eric.clst.org/tech/usgeojson/) and added a value for each state that represented if the Huskied had played a game there or not.
